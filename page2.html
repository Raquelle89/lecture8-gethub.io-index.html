		<h2> Why Pink and Green?</h2>

		<p>Pink and green seem to be the color combination of the moment. It's such a versatile pairing too that can have completely different vibes depending on the shades you choose. You could go soft and subtle with a sage green and pale pink or pick a bolder scheme with an emerald or olive green with a more vibrant pink. </p>

			<h3> Best Color Combo </h3>
			
			<p> It’s a combination we see a lot in nature, which is why we find it very comforting and cossetting when it comes to interiors. The emotive powers of these colors make this mix a favorite in bedrooms and bathrooms – green is restful and calming, while pink is soft and dreamy.</p>

<h3>Why Did I Choose This Color Scheme?</h3>

<p> I chose this color scheme because I am one of those people that believes Pink and green are the perfect color combination. I went to color-hex.com and chose the shade of pink I wanted and the complimentary color was a lime greenish color, so the desicision was easy.  </p>
